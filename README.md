## Research project

This is research project from unimelb. Implementing neural network models, especially pretrained language models (such as BERT), has become a main trend for various NLP tasks. When we think about how people actually learn language and use language, there are two significant points: 1. Process language in human brain 2. Understand language based on rich background knowledge. In this project, we will study the relationship between brain stracture and commonsense learning then try to apply the knowledge to downstream tasks.
